- 👋 Hi, I’m @bradleyap (a.k.a. Bradley Pliam)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that reduces silos and solves the problem of overgrown tech stacks that break.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that you can create something wonderful, but no one will care unless you get it out into the marketplace!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on your project, if it moves the needle, pushes the envelope and is not likely to be just one of many me too projects. I'd be willing to team up with someone to work on *any* Unitraverse.com -based projects
- 📫 How to reach me: support@unitraverse.com
